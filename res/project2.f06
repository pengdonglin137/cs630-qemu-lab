PROJECT #2                           Due Date: 7:30pm Tuesday 11/28/2006


     This project acquaints students with Pentium features which support
preemptive multitasking of a pair of application programs compiled under
Linux as executable ELF files, thereby requiring use of "virtual" memory
as well as periodic interrupts triggered by a peripheral device (such as
the programmable interval timer or the real-time clock).


                          PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

     Redesign your miniature operating system (named 'os630.s') in order
that it can employ "time-sharing" of the cpu to run two different tasks,
at privilege-level 3, both based upon the 'alphabet.s' demo-program that
is on our course website.  Task #1 should continuously display uppercase
letters in the upper half of the screen, while task #2 will continuously
display lowercase letters in the lower half of the screen.  To terminate
your demo, you should require your user to type <CONTROL>-C.   

     Because the ELF executable files produced by the 'as' assembler and
'ld' loader will be approximately 6KB in size, you will need to devise a
method for loading the two executables from areas of the boot-media that
currently are not accessed by our 'quikload.s' boot-loader (i.e., you'll
need a "second-stage" loader as part of your 'os630.s' implementation). 

     Use 'alpha_uc.s' and 'alpha_lc.s' as filenames for the source-texts 
of your two application tasks, and include their files with your project
submissions.  Use the following commands to prepare your boot-media when
testing your project:


		$ as alpha_uc.s -o alpha_uc.o
		$ ld alpha_uc.o -o alpha_uc
		$ dd if=alpha_uc of=/dev/dev4 seek=18

		$ as alpha_lc.s -o alpha_lc.o
		$ ld alpha_lc.o -o alpha_lc
		$ dd if=alpha_lc of=/dev/dev4 seek=36

		$ as os630.s -o os630.o
		$ ld os630.o -T ldscript -o os630.b
		$ dd if=os630.b of=/dev/sda4 seek=1

		$ as quikload.s -o quikload.o
		$ ld quikload.o -T ldscript -o quikload.b
		$ dd if=quikload.b of=/dev/sda4 


     As usual, you should place your assembly language source-files into
your '/submit' folder, along with the binaries generated from them.  And
you should turn in printouts of your source-texts to your Instructor.
